Just because in the past the weapons were a high conquest value, doesn't mean it has to stay that way (that was the first piece the new system gave us anyways).\n\nSecond one: Give upgrade tokens or something that add 5-10 ilvl per token and cost the same amount of conquest as a gear piece, that way we can still be competitive to PvE item level.\n\nThird one: Add item level scaling like we had in WoD for PvP combat. Now that World PvP is completely separate from PvErs, it seems like the perfect time to reintroduce this.\n\nWhere's the drawback? I just don't understand why the WoD system was removed in the first place, but now that gear matters again, it's CRUCIAL for PvPers to get to choose their gear. It doesn't make sense to restore customization... just to make us not really be able to reliably customize... Haste feels SOOOO important for so many classes due to the GCD changes, and when you can't get it, your class can just straight up feel terrible. Then you have azerite traits, which are the equivalent to legendaries in power at this point... and similarly like legendaries, they are locked behind RNG, and easier to get from PvE, which isn't acceptable for rated PvP.\n\nWe Need Gear Vendors",

            "best_post": "Well hey man, few things.\nPvP’ers are egotistical, or rather almost all gamers are; especially when referencing their favorite facet of the game. Let me help to explain why.\nSomeone like yourself who knows their class fairly well, is still going to have almost as hard of a time getting into pvp as someone even more fresh to the scene. This is because the required skills go beyond what you’ve needed to do thus far.\nYou primarily PvE right? You are like 3/8 mythic, you do 13-14 keys…so sure, you understand your abilities and when to use them against predetermined mechanics. You probably know how to dps without too much overlap to maximize that 1-2% deviance. That’s really where your advantage ends, and it’s not much. By comparison, this is the first expansion in… a decade really that I’ve raided and first time I’ve ever done mythic +. I’m also 3/8 Mythic and I regularly do 12ish keys. I super, super casually do that for the sake of weekly “chores” or just to get my pve chests and such. Doing that content is something I do while I kinda watch tv and just chill or eat. I’m only like a 2.2-2.3ish player on my best days. (Highest 2s mmr was like 2500). Now that’s not meant to be a brag to you or any other pvper, I know better than to brag about such a low rating on these forums, even if it is a personal best. It’s just that being a decent pvp’er trying to do pve chores is much easier than doing decent pve and trying to do pvp content; at least for me and most others that I know. For instance, once you learn a fight, which takes a 5 min YouTube video, then you’re good to go. No surprises, everything is scripted. Raiding, by comparison, is easy. Mythic+ is like trying to do a level of super Mario in a speed run. It’s super easy content. The only hard part is moving incredibly quickly without making mistakes or something. It’s not like…mentally taxing or require any critical thinking. Again, you have a game plan and you just stick to it.\nPvp is just different, and this is where your problems start to arise. You’re going against real people…things dynamically change. You need to outsmart humans. You need to have reactions to every possible thing someone can do. Now of course certain scenarios can be scripted. Some things warrant a certain response; there’s always a preferred reaction to things, but it doesn’t have to be. It’s up to the opponents’ strategy; something a pve’er has never dealt with. You can always have a wrench thrown in your plans.\nSo, to get to the long drawn out point, I’d argue that pvp is hard. You can say it’s not and call it convoluted but you and I both know that’s basically the same thing. It’s “difficult to get into or understand”… aka hard. It’s not hard to learn all the classes, that’s just memorizing. I get that. And it’s a LOT of memorizing. But it is hard to react appropriately to every single scenario from every comp playing as every comp; and not react like you’re taking a written test, react like within a second. It is hard to track drs and cds for your team and the enemy while analyzing what that means all the while playing. It is hard to position properly which is almost its own mini game within the mini game that is arena. There’s so much to do it can be overbearing. You have to think multiple steps in advance. Like chess. But you don’t take turns like a board game. You move as quickly as you can.\nSo respectfully, you’re just not mechanically there. You’re not mentally there either. You can’t be because you’ve never done these mechanics, and that’s okay. In order to get there, you have to respect the content and what you’re trying to do. It IS hard and you can’t tell yourself it’s not because you can do a 14 key. Of course that bleeds into people telling you “it’s easy, it’s easier than it’s ever been, it’s dumbed down” etc. This is just ego and/or familiarity. These are people who have been doing it for many years, like you said. It may be easier than it was but it will still always be more difficult than the other content. Human opponents are always harder than computers at top level, especially when these computers don’t even utilize AI really. And I understand these people demand a certain level of experience before even giving you time of day which can be frustrating for someone new. They do this because they don’t want to accompany someone else on their journey of learning, because they know just how long and arduous that can be.\nSo yeah you’re right on how others make it difficult to get into. But perhaps if you had a different mentality going in, as something that is new and challenging instead of just tedious and annoying, you’d have different results. Don’t blame the fact that you need to play a certain meta to succeed, because you don’t. There’s far more classes you can play than those you “can’t” and honestly you can play whatever you want up to 2k rating by most people’s standards. Learning the game is far more important than playing a fotm. If you think there’s too much cc, that’s just because it stops you from pve’ing which is your comfort zone. Either embrace pvp and truly try to learn, or don’t bother because it’ll only frustrate you.",

Note the base cost of the items were pulled from the beta on September 7th, and aren’t included in the list above.\nRight now, a battlegroud win on the beta awards 300 honor. Let’s throw in an additional 100 honor for mid-battleground rewards. So, 400 honor per win. We’ll say 100 honor per loss. I think this is generous, but humor me.\nLet’s say you have a 50% win loss rate, so we can average the win vs loss values.\nThis results in a 250 honor per battleground value.\nSo, take my havoc demon hunter value of 156,700 honor divided by 250 honor per battleground. This yields 627 battlegrounds.\nLet’s say a battleground takes an average of 15 minutes.\nThat’s 9,405 minutes in total\nThat’s 156.75 hours\nThat’s approximately 6.5 days\n6.5 days to get 190 ilvl gear.

            "best_post": "The current state of arena just might be the worst I can ever remember it being. I never have a queue session and have any fun at all, just frustration and a headache after every queue session.\nEVERY single game has a MW for a healer, in 2s and 3s. It’s almost as if other healing specs simply don’t exist anymore. If you do manage to find a unicorn that is any other healer, the game is drastically easier than even the really bad MW rerollers.\nThe recent nerfs to DKs/Eles didn’t seem to do anything at all, especially in the case of DKs. I find it amusing that the only issue they had pre-8.1 was their survivability, so for some reason Blizzard gave them one of the most OP pvp dps cds ever in this game, Raise Abomination. It’s even MORE amusing that I haven’t seen a single DK even running the new Lichborne talent to help their survivability, since death strike got so massively buffed.\nWe need hotfixes SOON, like in the next few days “soon”. I can’t imagine going another month with this awful meta. Here are some changes off of the top of my head that might make things better:\nMistweavers: Whether it will take multiple nerfs or just one big nerf, it’s hard to say. It’s hard to decide which is more broken: the short cd on cocoon, the ridiculous damage/healing of crane, or how they can top someone off in seconds even with no cooldowns up. Perhaps a flat % healing nerf overall is needed. Their mobility would be okay if their healing/damage output wasn’t so broken.\nDKs: Raise Abomination either needs a much shorter duration (as in half), or a doubled cooldown, or maybe give it a low health value so you can dispatch it quickly. That 25% nerf didn’t do anything. No pvp talent should be that strong. Death strike needs a nerf as well. Make it slightly better than pre-8.1, but it’s too strong as-is. The fact that no one even uses Lichborne is testament to this.\nIt also might be time to get rid of their interrupt from their empowered ghoul. Having 4 stops for casts from one spec alone is too much for how the game is now.\nWarlocks: The armor increase from demon armor was too much at 275%. Now they feel like pre-8.1 shadow priests, notably destro locks with demon armor. It should go back down to 200% as it was on the PTR. Warlocks should not have more armor than plate dps specs.\nEle Shamans: Their damage is still pretty stupid, but I think the lightning lasso hotfix was good, even though it’s still a pretty dumb ability. I think the main problem with them currently is how strong their off-healing is, and I think maybe a 15% nerf or so on healing surge might be warranted.\nShadow Priests: Was giving them greater fade really necessary, with the huge buff they got to dispersion? I don’t think so. Either up the cooldown on greater fade, or make it just a quick immunity (like 1 second) that they can use to skillfully avoid an incoming attack, like how demon hunters used to do in Legion with Blade Dance, before Blizzard broke that interesting mechanic by making it their main priority attack in their rotation.\nThere are plenty of more stupid things in the game, like the aforementioned current iteration of Blade Dance for DHs, and mages casting with shimmer, but I don’t see those getting fixed at all until the next expansion. The above suggested changes would at least hopefully make the rest of this season tolerable until the next season starts.",

Ironically fixing the bug and re-allowing cancelaura voidstone removed even more counterplay.\nThe stamina creep from going up 80k HP in one tier at same time that traits were halfed still hasn’t been addressed or compensated elsewhere damage wise with less gimmicky play styles instead of trait stacking for nerfed burst.\nDefensive azerite traits are still grossly overtuned since trait stacking was never addressed.\nEven more random passive defensive stuff is going to be added in through minor essences / the absorb weapon enchant in 8.2.\nA lot of the map pool favors defensive gameplay or druid/monk mobility like tolviron/black rook hold/mugambala/blade’s edge arena. Tiger’s peak still being bugged/not reintroduced for over 2 months now plays a part in this as well since it was one of the 3 fan favorite most balanced maps (alongside nagrand/ashamanes).\nPoor balancing compounds this defensively focused gameplay since:\nThe previous trait nerf/mana nerfs were lazy and imbalanced. Some of the most obvious factors being how easy it is for rdruids to drink or how much the game is played entirely around DPS selfhealing.\nThe PvE gear that has been nerfed like prism/trident/plate gloves are still BiS, because there’s slim to none trade off for wearing them.\nThe only decent PvP trinket is maledict (which fails as a band-aid for pacing). Also there’s no set bonus for wearing 2 pvp trinkets to encourage not wearing better PvE trinkets (ironically PvP on use stat trinkets are good in PvE, but can’t overpower the infinite amount of scripted defensives that are rotated in PvP).\nWe’ve got next to no class changes despite mountains of feedback from almost every tournament player on twitter and months of the same meta. *Besides the sub rogue changes that spiced things up for a couple of days even though assassination is still better.\nLots of classes have still been left in the dirt like disc priests or feral druids being worse than resto druids with feral affinity. Others have been broken for multiple expansions now like DH mana burn (despite it getting small nerf) or tank specializations that still breed non-interactive and uninteresting gameplay.\nThe gearing system is completely flawed:\nThey still haven’t addressed 10 quartermaster coins being a sigil instead of a trophy like they said in a interview.\nGladiator sigils not putting azerite at max level makes getting bad Box RNG on trophies extremely frustrating for using on BiS azerite from conquest rewards.\nThere’s no system of a pvp equivalent for residium.\nGems bring some customization, but ultimately can be frustrating for gearing when you RNG a gem on a piece with useless secondary stats or when someone else with good RNG has an advantage for having gems on every piece of gear.\nThere’s no way to target specific secondary stats since there isn’t even a watered down vendor yet. Even a combatant for gold/marks of honor to pick your secondaries properly and use sigils/trophies on would be a massive improvement.\nEven if there was a vendor like that and you were guarenteed a sigil every week in your box and glad sigil was on par with warlords trophy farming m+ would still be needed for BiS secondaries since a lot of stat combinations aren’t available on PvP gear. Especially since secondaries on PvP gear have been changing between seasons (s1 dagger having haste crit? vs s2 mastery crit, no mastery vers ring in s2, no caster offhand in loot table etc). A good example of this would be my main character’s armory https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/tichondrius/nahj 15 where excluding azerite/trinkets/weapons I’m wearing only 1 piece of pvp gear despite having higher item level pvp pieces because I want to stack mastery/versatility. Reforging would help this problem.\nThe tournament realm is hard to emulate practice for Pro’s without giving practice to other teams and hard for people to learn from watching events since it’s drastically different than the ladder based game. Due to player’s properly having their secondary stats and no PvE trinkets / crucible gear which ladder should learn from.\nI wish I got into beta to distract myself till the content drought ends, but I didn’t even get into the stress test. Hopefully classic does well enough to bring a wrath server to function as a timeless smash melee for the arena community. Even though late MoP was probably my favorite expansion for class design.\nIt’s optimistic to hope for, but hopefully some inspiration comes out of legacy class design influencing future retail expansions. Especially in regards to things like unpruned specializations that feel like different improved versions of the same class rather than entirely different classes that are missing 1/3rd of the toolkits.\nI just want to continue playing the game I’ve been passionate about for 10+ years for as long as I can. I’m still too addicted to quit, but even if I did i’ll always have some nostalgia over the past. However, I really hope to once again make new memories to think fondly about.",

Making each class worth 2 buttons also did more harm than good. Classes don’t feel rewarding to play. Also the concept of “bring the player not the class” needs to be back.\nSome specs are just incredibly disgusting to face against now while others are straight up useless unless you are decked out in mythic raid gear.\nJust a few things out of the many that need to be examined with great importance as we move on to next xpac. I would honestly play a whole new expansion with a promising direction if devs actually touched base on a lot of these problems and tried to fix them early on.",

We asked for gear to matter again but WE MEANT PVP GEAR MATTERING, NOT BROKEN PVE GEAR.

If you were a good player, be it dragonslaying or pvp - people knew who you were and respect was there.\nI didn’t have to look up someones Raiderio or armory them to see if they were “good”.\nI likely leveled with them.\nProbably fought horde alongside them in world pvp.\nHelped them fend off Horde during World Boss kills.\nThe list goes on and on.\nBasically, built camaraderie with my fellow neckbeards.\nBringing back classic isn’t about downing Ragnaros for the billionth time.\nIt’s about being a part of a gaming community that feels as real as a gaming community can feel.\nOh and some food for thought before i leave!\nEven if you despise the idea of classic servers understand how much it can help “live” gameplay.\nA lot of the mechanisms we miss that dramatically impact pvp/arena were present in Vanilla. And the success of Classic will surely lead to positive changes that even “live-only” players will love.\nAnd just think, if Classic goes well they have all but stated TBC would be next.\nIf that is indeed true i will never touch live again because TBC arena was incredible for so many reasons.\nAnywho, just my .02 copper on the subject.\nCheers!\nUncle Trafficz",

I’ll have to do Hello Kitty Island Adventures as well this week along with a +15 mythic and cap this toon in PVP.\nThe abundance of systems Blizzard has now put into the game is disgusting and gives me no hope for Shadowlands and the Tower of the Grind. I’m praying next week we only need to do 1 Horrific Vision for the cap to hit cloak rank 7. I’ve been doing them as a one wing + Thrall so far and it just isn’t fun repeatable content.\nOn top of all of it, it is fairly confusing. I wouldn’t expect casual players to grasp this latest system fairly quickly. I will be able to complete five more daily lesser visions to get a total of 5,000 more coalescing for the week and I know on Friday the minor invasion should reset allowing another 5,500 which will get me my 6th rank on cloak. Seems a little absurd that there is this much work involved to stay ahead on the drop.\nLastly, with how god awful that cloak quest was I’ve pretty much solidified myself to only playing one toon this patch unless somewhere along the way the clownshoes decide to take off their red nose and hand zappers to make this game less of a chore.",

They have come up with a system of vendors, where you get currency and spend it at a vendor, that will likely not deliver on the actual reasons that people liked the vendors in the first place.\nIt’s likely that you wont see every piece available but only an RNG selection each week.\nIt’s likely that PvE players will still gear more quickly, and PvP players will still find themselves compelled to participate in mythic+, raids, and Torghast if they want to gear at the fastest rate.\nIt’s likely that resilience, PvP power, etc are NOT coming back.\nBlizzard seems to think that any system they invent, as long as it has currency and vendors, will be accepted by players when the truth is that what players have wanted all along is for playing PvP to be the optimal way to make your character stronger in PvP, and for this to happen in a manner that doesn’t involve RNG but rather you can know in advance “ok on X week I will purchase Y piece”.\nAs long as the system “fits into [Blizzard’s] broader itemization plans” it does not seem likely that Blizzard will deliver on the spirit of this request.\nSource for the quote: interview of the game director by some Twitch streamer (it’s available on mmoc front page)",

Besides conquest being unacceptably slow to obtain for alts who get stomped once you get to the hard stuck 1800 440 gear bracket, the idea that the game knows what order we should gear is insulting and ignores the random nature of acquiring gear outside of PvP to begin with.\nPlease just add the system back that worked. Keeping an artificial barrier to entry is not wise and has really made the PvP scene absurdly more difficult to get into",

That is the base template implemented after other scaling issues so that way you can’t tank your item level down to zero to get massive damage boost.\nNow if you equip an 200 ilvl green item your PvP level actually doesn’t change. Since the 200 ilvl green is below your static 286 item level set template.\nSo in the test below I equipped the Legendary 267 belt from Legion and obviously it didn’t raise my item level past the 286 template. However when I add 1 socket my PvP item level raises up by .6 item levels to 286.6!!! Here is the problem!!! This belts item level in PvP should be 267.6\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nd7Zqwa\nIn the second picture I added another gem and it adds another .6 item level to total PvP level which is completely incorrect. It should be changing the item you are socketing .6 item levels.\nSo my 267 belt with 2 sockets jumped my overall PvP item level from 286 to 287.2 instead of changing what it was supposed to which is my 267 belt should now be 268.2.\nSo now all Blizzard needs to do is to make sure sockets are being applied to the actual item instead of the overall PvP level causing the negative effects of using gems in PvP. Hopefully they fix this bug soon.\nI have some more testing to do because this scaling system was made so much more complicated then they need to as I search for what is actually BiS gear and how to Min/Max properly.\n#RemoveScaling\n#SaveShadowLands",

            "best_post": "BEGIN_QUOTE 12/10/2017 11:02 AMPosted by Venruki\nHello friends, I am writing this post due to recent concerns regarding PvP gear.\n\nApologize in advance for the massive use of the terms \"PvP gear\" and \"PvE gear\".\n\nThe only advantage PvP gear has in PvP or any other aspect of the game is its item level. PvE set bonuses and trinkets are still far superior in both high end raiding and high end mythic dungeons. This makes sense, high end raiding and dungeons should have beneficial gear for their type of game play.\n\nThe issue I'm having is now PvE gear is both easier to obtain and higher item level then its PvP counterpart. Gearing has essentially become irrelevant in PvP and has really taken a back seat this expansion. As a result, its feel like participation is down more than ever.\n\nI'll give you a bit of an anecdote: I've been playing the game since vanilla and haven't really dipped my feet in much PvE content since early WOTLK. This expansion with +10/+15 chests rewards from Mythic+, I decided it was worth my time to complete this task weekly. I didn't feel like I was wasting my time and ended up enjoying the content as a way to progress my character. As a result I've come to really enjoy this type of content and now participate in Mythic raiding as well. If there wasn't that initial incentive to try the content and feel good about getting gear, I never would of done it in the first place.\n\nWith that in mind I'd like to now compare ways to gear in PvP content vs PvE content. Strictly in terms of item level here's a list from worst to best.\n\n845 From normal dungeons\n870 Random battlegrounds\n885 Mythic +0\n900 Crafting with blood of sargeras\n900 Chest from winning a brawl once every two weeks.\n910 Reliquished\n915 LFR Antorus\n925 LFR Argus\n930 Normal Antorus\n930 Rare drop from being 2400 rated in arena and winning a match.\n940 Guaranteed from every mythic +15\n940 Weekly PvP cap for being 2000 rated in arena.\n940 Normal Argus\n945 Heroic Antorus\n950 Weekly PvP cap for being 2400 rated in arena.\n955 Heroic Argus\n960 Mythic Antorus & Weekly chest from m+ 15\n970 Mythic Argus\n\nThese aren't the only ways of gearing but most.\n\nFor a new or casual player it's easy to see why gearing in PvE is not only much more rewarding but also guaranteed.\n\nDo you know how many times I've heard my PvP buddies say \"Lets go get our weekly +15 done\" compared to my PvE friends saying \"Lets go get 2400 rating so we can get our weekly cap done!\". Even if you completely disregard the difficulty of achieving that rating in PvP, there's a monumental time difference in the two tasks, they're not even comparable. And yet, the weekly chest is still higher item level.\n\nA reasonable item level to compete at higher end PvP and PvE is around 940.\nAnyone aiming for this goal wouldn't waste their time PvP.\n\nReminder:\n\n940 Guaranteed from every mythic +15 (GUARANTEED FOR COMPLETING, NOT EVEN IN TIME)\n940 Weekly PvP cap for being 2000 rated in arena. (ONCE A WEEK)\n940 Normal Argus (ONCE A WEEK)\n945 Heroic Antorus (10 BOSSES A WEEK)\n950 Weekly PvP cap for being 2400 rated in arena. (ONCE A WEEK)\n955 Heroic Argus (ONCE A WEEK)\n960 Mythic Antorus (10 BOSSES A WEEK) & Weekly chest from m+ 15 (ONCE A WEEK)\n970 Mythic Argus (ONCE A WEEK)\n\nHere's my WW monks armory: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/tichondrius/venfuki 4\n\nI've played 219 games of arena this season at roughly 2500 MMR & 2400 CR. So far this season I've received 0 upgrades. The only pieces of PvP gear that remain for me are 2 pieces of elite warforged, something most players would never have access to. What's really disheartening is this problem is even worse for casual, low rated and mid tier PvPers.\n\nPeople should feel incentivized to play all aspects of WoW. Currently PvP gear has taken a massive back seat and as a result participation and interest feels lower than ever.\n\nAm I alone in feeling this way? END_QUOTE. \n\n\n*Slow clap*\n\nYes, thank you for posting this as I have tried to highlight this where ever I can. I am not asking for elite gear for us bottom feeders.\n\nWhen I started playing...being able to target and obtain an honor set via doing PVP was the pure greatest joy I had playing this game.\n\nSure, in Legion I have access to gear that is greater than honor set but I didn't do any PVP to obtain it. And frankly hitting two buttons in PVE to obtain argunite isn't interesting game play to be honest.\n\nPVP gearing system needs some serious help for players at the top, bottom and mid range players. For the rated and non rated players and also for returning players coming mid or late into the season.",

Season 1 I was able to get duelist, relatively easy. 8.1.5 nerfs came and I lost motivation with the nerfs.\nFast forward to S3 and I’m more comfortable with disc. However, I am out of ideas when it comes to Unholy Death Knights. Nothing I try works. This has been the hardest climb I have ever done. This is more of a problem in 2’s, but I encounter it often in 3s.\nUnhealable damage. My healing throughput is through damage and every single match I am getting trained, tunneled, deeply penetrated, any sexual innuendo you can think of, I’ve been through it… but I digress. I can’t play my class the way it works versus this class. Every single match goes the same way. DK runs to me, pops 1 shot macro, and almost globaling me INSIDE Power Word: Barrier which is UPGRADED by my Dome of Light PvP talent. Everyone knows stacking defensives is a terrible idea. But versus DKs I literally have no option. The split second my dome ends, I have to rapture. By this time, I have both the dk and his resto druid training me. I tell every single dps I run with to start on the DK, as I’m disc and need to get the ball rolling with damage. But it’s impossible unless it’s a rogue, maybe a mage. I cannot spend a single GCD on an offensive spell, save fear or knockback. I waste enough time fake-casting 2 interrupts, a grip and a stun.\nI’ve looked around everywhere, skill-capped, reddit, forums, youtube videos and I can’t find a way around it. Lately I’ve been trying out Zunniyaki’s build with mostly using Twist of Fate and Archangel, Dark Arch, and Dome talents with some nice success but vs Death Knights, I’m still struggling.\nAny experienced Discipline priests around?",

            "best_post": "If you won’t take the players word for it, how about Blizzard’s own?\nBEGIN_QUOTE I’ve Got the Power!\nIn Mists of Pandaria, we added PvP Power as a stat that would allow PvP gear to be functionally superior to Raid and Dungeon gear in PvP combat, without exceeding the value of its equivalent PvE gear in PvE content. That was largely a success within instanced PvP Arenas and Battlegrounds, but we think we can do better while also ensuring outdoor world PvP is able to benefit from that same intent. So, in Warlords of Draenor, we’re taking a different approach.\nPvP gear in Warlords will no longer have PvP-specific stats. Instead, it will scale up to a higher item level as soon as you enter a designated PvP area, such as an Arena or Battleground, or as soon as you enter PvP combat anywhere else in the world. If you’re out questing with PvP gear, the item’s base item level will be used while fighting back the Iron Horde, but the second that raiding druid tries to gank you, your higher PvP item level kicks in and you’ll have the upper-hand. Each piece of PvP gear will have its PvP item level displayed clearly on its tooltip, so there’s no guesswork involved.\nOn top of that, all gear—even gear found in PvE content—will be scaled up to a certain minimum item level in any designated PvP area. That minimum is still lower than any of the actual PvP gear, but a fresh level 100 character who’s just wearing some dungeon gear, or even whatever they picked up while questing, will not be at quite as severe a disadvantage should they choose to step into a Skirmish or Random Battleground.\nOne added advantage of this new system is that most PvE gear will no longer need to be downscaled in PvP areas, as the equivalent PvP gear is already a higher item level in PvP situations. Instead of making players wearing PvE gear feel weaker in PvP, we make players wearing PvP gear feel stronger. The only exception is Mythic raid gear. Mythic’s PvE item level and Conquest’s PvP item level are very close, so we’ll be downscaling Mythic gear slightly in designated PvP areas just to make sure that Conquest gear remains the best available for PvP. END_QUOTE. \nhttps://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/310640-warlords-of-draenor-equipping-for-battle/ 1\nPlease do the right thing, bring back this amazing system for PVP gear, that would be even better with WarMode now implemented.",

Performance anxiety being probably the biggest one.\nIf your getting anxiety during arena your probably getting anxiety in other aspects of your life. This is just a sign that you need to really focus on ur mental hygiene which a lot of gamers neglect. Exercise, eat healthy, get good sleep, take breaks if your playing wow all day, lean on others for support, and don’t be scared to talk to friends family or a professional if your struggling.\nI used to not be able to leave the house due to crippling panic attacks. Since then my mental health has always been my #1 priority and I have a completely normal life now. Every once in awhile I’ll get some anxiety or panic feeling but it’s much more controlled.\nAnyways good luck my dude and if anyone is struggling and needs someone to talk to btag me youchie#1413",

(And many others, for that matter)\nOkay here we go. First talent row you have to choose between: Evasion, Cloak of Shadows and Crimson Vial\nSecond talent row: Shadowstep, Sprint, Vanish\nThird talent row: Sap, Blind, Kidney\nFourth talent row: Gouge, Cheap Shot, Feint\nYou see what I’m getting at? This is what actual pruning looks like, and I’m only getting at the tip of the iceberg here.\nSounds way, WAY too extreme and overblown? Well yeah, guess what? This is what happened to many other classes.\nRogues lost nothing of significance, at least compared to almost all the other classes.\nAnd please, I know the examples are not even good in some cases, and that I mix it up between “Rogue” and “Assassination”, but it should still illustrate pretty well at what I’m getting at here.\nOver time, some classes definitely lost not only their toolkit, but they also had to trade something in return if they want to have a strength in some way.\nRogue on the other hand only lost the tradeoffs, while never getting their strengths adjusted down in order to re-balance this.\nStealth has no penalty anymore, heck you even move faster.\nAltough it really is absolutely necessary that Vanish had to be fixed, and stealth in that regard as well, it’s just unjustified that you can’t even punish a Rogue for catching him out of stealth, because he still has more than enough time to get the opener.\nCombo Points are on you, not on the target. Why does Sap still exist as a 8s incap, with no risk whatsoever with its asinine range…? I could go on and on.\nFear was nerfed from 8s to 6s 2 expansions ago, justifiably so. Many DRs were changed. Kidney is still a 6s stun on 20s CD.\nAgain… I’m really exaggerating here and not every comparison is fair or even. Yet it still goes to show as to why people really roll their eyes when Rogues think they have been pruned on par with other classes.",

I’m not even sure how many games I’ve won or lose at an even playing field. When you do fight someone who has full mythic gear double slappers it feels pretty bad. Not only because it feels like an uphill battle but because you can’t obtain similar quality through arena. PvP has always been my go to content and it’s really fun to play alts in. I really hope we see some changes and see the vendors move to a more MoP or WoD style.\nThe skill cap some might think has reduced over the last few years which I can agree with but it feels awful for gear>skill to matter so much. Would love to carry around a PvP set that’s full epics and that I had earned to play vs others with the same. Then slap on a PvE set if I want to d that content (the stats are never the same like the video states). Also more stat iterations.\nPlease let’s get together and actually get this changed before Shadowlands starts",

Frequently in our match ups he runs DarkS for the first game of a series then swaps to something else afterwards cause he gets so little value out of it.\nMes on the other hand is one of those players I celebrate when I dodge his kick (others being Maldiva/Thugonmicz). Mes hits like 80% of his kicks on me. His Dark Sim usage is utterly brutal. When I play caster cleaves vs Mes it feels like my casters are 1500 moron braindead chimps with the constant poly/fear/clone steals against my 2.7k-3100xp caster partners.\nDK damage isn’t particularly difficult to do right now. It’s as close to unhealable as steady pressure can get. However, what sets Mes apart is his incredible consistency in a match. He’s multitudes more disruptive than any other DK I’ve faced while still delivering incredible pressure. Add in that he has a positive mental attitude and never approaches a game as unwinnable you have yourself the perfect partner.",

That is LOL terrible.\nYou expect us to actually believe, that someone wrote this post, proof-read it, let at least one other person proof read it, allowed Ion to talk about revamped rewards for PvP only for it to be a typo?\nNo, sorry, but no. Please upgrade this to what the reward should be. You allowed people to believe for several months that this would be a Trophy. You are finding out now because people attempted to turn this quest in and are confused.\nThis is akin to PvE raiders receiving the transmog mace from Taloc at the 355/370 Ivl incorrectly. You let them keep it. That was a typo.\nThis is a flat out backpedal. Fix it.",
